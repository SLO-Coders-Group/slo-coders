### Dev Notes

This is a Next JS project with React and MUI.

Most of it has been built either while half asleep after the kids are in bed or while multi-tasking, so don't judge me too harshly. :laughing:

### Data Notes

Each section on the website has it's own TypeScript object, which is easy to modify. The files are located here: `src/data`.
