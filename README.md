## Hi! Thanks for being here :)

Please feel free to contribute!

### Dev Notes

This is a Next JS project with React and MUI.

Most of it has been built late when my kids are asleep and I can manage to still be awake. So, feel free to do any cleanup needed! Or data additions/fixes, improvements, new features, etc. If you have ideas, we will take them! Need help implementing? Let us know and we can help!

### TODO

1. Create an API in NextJS using the data in `src/data` and use that to pull in the data instead
   - [ ] create an API in NextJS based on the data in `src/data`
     - [use SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview)
   - [ ] use the API to display the information on the page

2. Display Glassdoor Ratings on Businesses page
   - [ ] create an API in NextJS that scrapes the ratings
     - they have an API, but it's currently "not in use" (I contacted them to ask)
     - probably use Cheerio?
       - https://cheerio.js.org/
       - https://nextjs-scraper-playground.vercel.app/
       - [use SSG or ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview)
   - [ ] use the API to display the information on the page

3. Create a jobs page that somehow pulls in any open coding jobs that are on LinkedIn for any of the businesses on our Businesses page
