# SLO County Coders

## Hi! Thanks for being here :sunglasses:

Please feel free to contribute! Your time and effort will benefit the current and future members of our community tremendously!

### Dev Notes

This is a Next JS project with React and MUI.

Most of it has been built either while half asleep after the kids are in bed or while multi-tasking, so don't judge me too harshly. :laughing: Please always feel free to implement or suggest code improvements or cleanup. We also very much welcome more data additions/fixes, improvements, new features, etc. If you have ideas, we will take them! Need help implementing? Let us know and maybe we can help!

### TODO

Here are some items on our to-do list that we haven't had time to implement yet. Please help if you can! Don't be shy!

1. Create an API in NextJS using the data in `src/data` and use that to pull in the data instead

   - [ ] create an API in NextJS based on the data in `src/data`
     - [use SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview)
   - [ ] use the API to display the information on the page

2. Display Glassdoor Ratings on Businesses page

   - [ ] create an API in NextJS that scrapes the ratings
     - they have an API, but it's currently "not in use" (I contacted them to ask)
     - probably use Cheerio?
       - https://cheerio.js.org/
       - https://nextjs-scraper-playground.vercel.app/
       - [use SSG or ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview)
   - [ ] use the API to display the information on the page

3. Create a jobs page that somehow pulls in any open coding jobs that are on LinkedIn for any of the businesses on our Businesses page

   - [ ] create an API in NextJS that scrapes the jobs
     - probably use Cheerio?
       - https://cheerio.js.org/
       - https://nextjs-scraper-playground.vercel.app/
       - [use SSG or ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview)
   - [ ] use the API to display the information on the page

4. Add some kind of "idea board" to the website for suggestions from non-members

   - [ ] Investigate which idea might be best and how we might achieve it
     - I'm thinking something that looks like sticky notes could be fun?
     - A different idea would be to do something like StackOverflow where people can just add an idea and other people can thumbs up or down
   - [ ] Implement idea
