# SLO County Coders

## Hi! Thanks for being here :sunglasses:

**Please feel free to contribute!** Your time and effort will benefit the current and future members of our community tremendously!

### Dev Notes

This is a Next JS project with React and MUI.

Most of it has been built either while half asleep after the kids are in bed or while multi-tasking, so don't judge me too harshly. :laughing: Please always feel free to implement or suggest code improvements or cleanup. We also very much welcome more data additions/fixes, improvements, new features, etc. If you have ideas, we will take them! Need help implementing? Let us know and maybe we can help!

### TODO

Check out the [Issues tab on Github](https://github.com/SLO-Coders-Group/slo-coders/issues) for our list of to-dos for the website. Please help if you can! Don't be shy!
