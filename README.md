## Hi! Thanks for being here :)

Please feel free to contribute!

### Dev Notes

This is a Next JS project with React and MUI.

Most of it has been built late when my kids are asleep and I can manage to still be awake. So, feel free to do any cleanup needed! Or data additions/fixes, improvements, new features, etc. If you have ideas, we will take them! Need help implementing? Let us know and we can help!

### TODO

- Create an API in NextJS using the data in `src/data` and use that to pull in the data instead

  - [ ] create an API in NextJS based on the data in `src/data`
    - use SSG for now (getStaticProps) so that it pulls the data on build
  - [ ] use the API to display the information on the page

- Display Glassdoor Ratings on Businesses page

  - [ ] create an API in NextJS that scrapes the ratings
    - they have an API, but it's currently "not in use" (I contacted them to ask)
    - probably use Cheerio?
      - https://cheerio.js.org/
      - https://nextjs-scraper-playground.vercel.app/
  - [ ] use the API to display the information on the page

- Create a jobs page that somehow pulls in any open coding jobs that are on LinkedIn for any of the businesses on our Businesses page
  - [ ] create an API in NextJS that scrapes the jobs
    - probably use Cheerio?
