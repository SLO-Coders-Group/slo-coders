## Hi! Thanks for being here :)

Please feel free to contribute!

### Dev Notes

This is a Next JS project with React and MUI.

Most of it has been built late when my kids are asleep and I can manage to still be awake. So, feel free to do any cleanup needed! Or data additions/fixes, improvements, new features, etc. If you have ideas, we will take them! Need help implementing? Let us know and we can help!
